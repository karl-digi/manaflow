Do not use .unwrap (except in tests).
Make sure to run clippy and fix all lint warnings.
Before finishing, make sure to run tests.
After tests pass, ALWAYS run `./scripts/reload.sh` to rebuild the CLI, rebuild the Docker container, and restart the dev server. This ensures the user has the latest changes immediately available.
After finishing, use the macOS `say` command to notify the user with a short description of what to check/the next action the user should take (like a shell command/url/program they should interact with to verify the work done).
Do not dispatch the `say` command until you've read and verified the outputs of bot the test results and `./scripts/reload.sh`.
